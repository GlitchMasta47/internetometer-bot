# internetometer-bot
Bot for internetometer.com (of course) written in Node.js because it's much simpler than any other bot that I've found.

There ~~is~~ will be a running instance at https://www.internetometer.com/give/47562 (don't vote for this user unless you want to donate to the cause, as I'd like the count to be a good representation of what this software can do)

## Pre-built Binaries
There ~~are~~ will be pre-built binaries available for instant use on the [releases page](https://www.github.com/glitchmasta47/internetometer-bot/releases). You can also run direct from the source with instructions from the [Pre-requisites section](#pre-requisites) and the [Setup section](#setup).

## Pre-requisites
- A modern-ish version of Node.js ([download](https://www.nodejs.org/))
- Internet
- Also an internetometer.com account (of course)

## Setup
You can quickly run it with npx:
```sh
npx internetometer-bot
```

Or, you can download the source and run it directly:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/glitchmasta47/internetometer-bot.git/
cd internetometer-bot
npm install
node .
```
